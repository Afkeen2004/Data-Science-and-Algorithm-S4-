## Cycle-1-Part-A-Assignment
Introduction for DSA (Recall to S3 Program Design) - Stack, Queue, Linked list

**Q1:** You have given mathematical expressions which have some duplicate parentheses. The expressions consist of lowercase alphabets and operators (+, -, *, /, ˆ , %) without space, Your goal is to identify and flag expressions that have duplicate parentheses. Duplicate parentheses occur when the same subexpression is enclosed by multiple sets of parentheses. It’s important to note that a single alphabet or operator by itself is also considered a valid expression.

**Q2:** A Singly linked list L is a data structure in which the objects are arranged in a linear order. Each node of a Singly linked list L is an object with an attribute key and one pointer attribute, next. Given a node x in the list, x.next points to its successor in the linked list. An attribute L.head points to the first node of the list.

**Q3:** You are responsible for designing a system to manage an emergency room (ER) using a priority queue(max heap). Patients arrive at the ER and are characterized by their name, condition severity (priority), and admit time(admitTime).

## Cycle-1-Part-B-Assignment
Binary Tree and BST

**Q1:** Given an inorder and a preorder traversal of a binary tree, construct the unique binary tree T corresponding to the traversals given.

**Q2:** Given the PARENTHESIS REPRESENTATION of the binary Tree T with n nodes (where n ∈ [1,104 ] ). Write a menu driven program to implement the operations Levelordertraversal, MaximumSumBSt, RightView.
 
**Q3:** Given the PARENTHESIS REPRESENTATION of a binary search tree(BST) T with n nodes (where n ∈[1,103 ]). Write a menu driven program to implement the operations PrintRangeValues, Ancestors.

## Cycle-1-Part-C-Assignment
Hashing

**Q1:** Given two integer arrays A and B, implement the functions on them using hashing Union, intersection, setdifference.

**Q2:** You are tasked with implementing a hash table using chaining as the collision resolution method.

**Q3:** Our institute decided to split the students into four groups to conduct an event. The procedure for splitting is as follows: h(A) = (Sum of ASCII value of the characters in the first name of ‘A’ + age of ‘A’) % 4, where ‘A’ represents a student.

**Q4:** Open addressing is a method for handling collisions in hashing. The three different methods for open addressing are linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing.

**Q5:** Given an array A of N integers and an integer K, return the count of distinct integers in all windows of size K.
 
## Cycle-2-Part-A-Assignment
AVL Trees and Red Black Trees

**Q1:** You are given a sequence of operations to perform on an AVL tree. Each operation is represented by a character followed by its respective parameters. The operations are as follows: [ i , x , p , s ,e]

**Q2:** You are tasked with implementing a data structure that mimics the functionality of an ordered map using and AVL Tree. An ordered map, also known as a map or dictionary, is a data structure  that stores a collection of key-value pairs. Unlike a regular hash map, an ordered map maintains the keys in sorted order, allowing efficient retrieval of elements in a sorted sequence based on their keys. Your main() function shall read the choice from the console and call the functions appropriately

**Q3:** Write a program to Create a Red Black Tree from the given input.

**Q4:** Given a parenthesis representation of a tree. Construct the tree for the given input and check whether the tree satisfies the red-black tree properties or not. Write a function “checkRedblack- Tree(root)” to check the tree is red-black tree or not and return return boolean values 1 if it is a red-black tree otherwise 0.

## Cycle-3-Part-A-Assignment
Graphs: BFS & DFS

**Q1:** You are given an undirected graph G. Implement the following using DFS as a sub-routine; noOfConnectedComponents(G), sizeOfComponents(G), noOfBridges(G), noOfArticulationPoints(G)

**Q2:** Given a directed graph containing N nodes as an adjacency matrix,implement the following using
a Breadth-First Search(BFS) traversal algorithm; Is Topological sort possible(), Number of strongly components()

**Q3:** You are given an integer N representing the number of nodes in the graph . The graph is represented
by adjacency list .The next N lines represent an adjacency list where first integer is node itself and
next integers are the nodes adjacent to it in ascending order . The goal is to implement the following
using a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal algorithm; All path(Node1,Node2), valid tree()

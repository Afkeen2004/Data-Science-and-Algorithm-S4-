## Cycle-1-Part-A-Assignment
Introduction for DSA (Recall to S3 Program Design) - Stack, Queue, Linked list

**Q1:** You have given mathematical expressions which have some duplicate parentheses. The expressions
consist of lowercase alphabets and operators (+, -, *, /, ˆ , %) without space, Your goal is to
identify and flag expressions that have duplicate parentheses. Duplicate parentheses occur when 
the same subexpression is enclosed by multiple sets of parentheses. It’s important to note that a
single alphabet or operator by itself is also considered a valid expression.

**Q2:** A Singly linked list L is a data structure in which the objects are arranged in a linear order.
Each node of a Singly linked list L is an object with an attribute key and one pointer attribute,
next. Given a node x in the list, x.next points to its successor in the linked list. An attribute
L.head points to the first node of the list.

**Q3:** You are responsible for designing a system to manage an emergency room (ER) using a priority
queue(max heap). Patients arrive at the ER and are characterized by their name, condition
severity (priority), and admit time(admitTime).
